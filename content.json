    "bharatanatyamParagraphs": [
      "Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest classical dance forms originating from Tamil Nadu in South India. With a history spanning over 5000 years, it combines precise footwork (nritta), expressive storytelling (abhinaya), and symbolic hand gestures (mudras) to create a visually stunning and emotionally rich performance art.",
      "The dance form is characterized by its fixed upper torso, bent legs, and elaborate footwork. Dancers tell stories through a complex language of gestures and expressions, often depicting mythological themes and spiritual concepts from Hindu texts.",
      "Bharatanatyam performances are traditionally accompanied by Carnatic music, with rhythmic patterns set by the mridangam (drum) and melodic framework provided by vocals and instruments like the veena and flute."
